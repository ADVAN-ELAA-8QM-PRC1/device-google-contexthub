/*
 * System calls are indexed by an unsigned 32-bit constant path. To avoid having a
 * single gigantic table, we use a system of 4-level tables to dispatch them. In
 * order of use the tables use: 5, 10, 8, 9 bits, from high to low, so for example
 * syscall 0x19918FC8 would use table indices 3, 200, 199, 456 since it is equal to
 * (3 << (10 + 8 + 9)) + (200 << (8 + 9)) + (199 << 9) + 456. Each table may be
 * truncated (with a length field specified), and may be in RAM or ROM, as seen fit.
 * The expected use case is that the first level detemines grand purpose
 * (OS, driver, google app, 3rd party app, etc), second level determines vendor,
 * third level determines subsystem, and the last level determines desired function.

/*
 * Userspace callbacks are a complicated topic. They allow us to call back to a userspace
 * piece of code in userspace context. This is rather complicated, and so these functions
 * exist to simplify it. The callbacks are allowed up to 4 params, of uintptr_t size. They
 * are also allowed a single uintptr_t return value. First, one must create a callback
 * state. The function syscallUserspaceCallbackAlloc() can be used for that. It takes in
 * the callback function pointer as well as up to four params. It creates a reusable state
 * structure that can be used to call this callback as many times as one wishes. The params
 * are saved in the struct, as is the function pointer. The inverse of this function is
 * syscallUserspaceCallbackFree(). It frees the state. To actually call the callback, use
 * syscallUserspaceCallbackCall(). It takes in the struct, and optionally can override the
 * params with new values. If you wish to do that, pass non-NULL values as overrideParam#P.
 * The override values are NOT saved in the struct, and are only used for this one call.
